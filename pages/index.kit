        Hello from index.kit! I am located in the <code>pages</code> folder alongside <code>index.styl</code>.
        Here you'll keep all your markup and styles like <code>aboutUs.kit</code> and <code>aboutUs.styl</code>.
        <b>Feel free to replace the code from <code>index.kit</code> and <code>index.styl</code> with your own.</b>
        If you want to add reusable components like <code>nav</code> or <code>footer</code>,
        use the <code>components</code> folder instead of the <code>pages</code> folder.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 2 folders I didn't mention are <b><code>build</code> and <code>assets</code></b>.
        <code>build</code> is where the compiled <code>.kit</code> files go. Ignore this folder.
        <code>assets</code> is where you'll keep your JavaScript, images, Stylus, and compiled Stylus (or CSS).
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, I scattered a few <b>commented lines of code</b> in this boilerplate to help you get your bearings.
        For instance, <b>here are a few <code>.kit</code> snippets</b> you might use:
      </p>

      <code>
        &lt;!-- $title = "Home | My Site" --&gt;<br>
        &lt;!-- @import ../components/header.kit --&gt;
      </code>

      <p>
        <b>A note about CSS.</b> This boilerplate uses <b>Stylus</b>, which supports CSS, SASS, and SCSS syntax.
        <b>I've included 4 files</b>: <code>main.styl</code> for importing other Stylus files,
        <code>mixins.styl</code> for bunching commonly used styles and responsive mixins,
        <code>reset.styl</code> for fixing ugly browser defaults,
        and <code>theme.styl</code> for styling things like <code>input</code>, <code>h1</code>, and document fonts.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>A note about this boilerplate.</b>
        The intended use is to take your Sketch/XD design and quickly code the styles and HTML layout in a <b>static</b> site.
        Then, when you migrate to WordPress, Angular, React, or some other dynamic site,
        you'll already have all your CSS coded.
