# Getting Started
- Run `npm install` and `gulp`.
- Keep in mind:
    All `.styl` files get compiled to `assets/css/main.css`.
    Putting `/build` in the browser URL is optional.

# TODO
- Possibly add Polymer??
- Check if this interferes with MAMP??

- Add articles thingy
- Add students & work from students
