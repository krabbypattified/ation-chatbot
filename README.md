# NOTES

This boilerplate uses Gulp, Stylus, and Kit.

Its intended use is to build-out Sketch/XD apps in a static site and quickly migrate it to WordPress.
This also seems to work well without a WordPress-related workflow.
If you want to use a JavaScript framework, I suggest modifying the boilerplate file structure to be more organized.

TODO
- Possibly add Polymer
- Check if this interferes with MAMP

# USAGE / DOCS

- Run `npm install` and `gulp`.
- Keep in mind:
    You can uncomment stuff to test it out!
    Stylus supports css, sass, and scss syntax.
    All `.styl` files get compiled to `assets/css/main.css`.
    Putting `/build` in the browser URL is optional.
